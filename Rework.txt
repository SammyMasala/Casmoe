Design brief for UI Rework

Summary: 

Casmoe's ordinary user interface consists of 2 main pages: Home and Case View.

- Home is the default page when users first load the site. By default, the home page will show a large viewport length input field to upload the .csv file. Upon uploading, the field moves to the top of the page and case browser container becomes visible. This container consists of a left and right panel. the left "CaseList" panel lists the cases found in the uploaded csv file. This panel should occupy at least 70% of the viewport width to denote it as the primary panel. The right "Preview" panel shows a simplified Case View that allows users to verify that they have selected the intended case by previewing it. After a case is selected, a large button should be displayed to "Go to Case View"

- Case View is the focus page of the Casmoe tool. The page leads with a header containing 2 tabs, "Text", and "Analysis". "Overview" is the leftmost default tab, and shows a simplified unified display of the "Text" and "Analysis" panels. The "Text" panel shows the selected case in Line View, i.e broken up into individual line entries. These entries can be clicked/hovered over to view annotation information in a popout box. The "Analysis" panel displays a number of charts and graphics that are generated using the case annotation data. 

Super User/Editor functionality:

A super user login option will be available at the top right of the screen. When logged in as a super user, users will be treated to an entirely independent version of the tool, the Casmoe Editor. This editor site version will have a different color palette to denote the distinction from the normal user experience. The Editor user interface consists of 3 pages: Home, Edit and Review.

- the Home page for super users will be identical to the user version. However, it will use the editor colour palette and include an 'EDITOR MODE' tag on the header to show clear differentiation.   

- the Edit page for super users will also be similar to the normal user version. However, 2 additional features will are added to the annotation viewer: Firstly, the annotation values will be editable. Secondly, a new footer is added to save the edited entry to the database. 

- the Review page is a brand new page exclusive to super users. The page consists of two main elements, a large upper 'View Changes' panel occupying the top-middle of the page, and a smaller lower 'Commit changes' panel occupying the bottom of the page. the 'View Changes' panel displays a list of all changed caseline entries saved to the database. Importantly, a checkbox is present for each line for users to select which line to be committed to export via the second panel below. Optional features include sorting by case/sentence id, or other methods to make browsing more organized than simply by entry date. The 'Commit' panel will allow users to export the selected entries as a csv. There are two important steps to this export process, indicated by two rows in the panel: In step 1, users will choose whether to export as a new file, or to merge it into an existing corpus. In selecting the latter option, users will be prompted to input a csv file. users will also be warned that the process will overwrite entries in the selected csv with the same key (case_id + sentence_id). In step 2, users will be given two commit option: commit, and commit AND delete. The latter option deletes selected line entries from the site database after exporting them. 

//NEW: Home page. A new home page to unify navigation between normal and super users. This home page emphasizes visual appeal, in the form of a minimalist interface consisting of less than 5 big vibrant buttons. the New Home page layout consists of a header and a main body. The header displays the site name and the Login button for super users. The main body displays comically large (> 30% viewport width?) buttons denoting page information for users to click and navigate to the pages found in the editor tool. For normal users, there is 1 page button available: Search. For super users, there are 2 page buttons: Review and Edit. Not all pages are available on the New Home as some require prerequisite data to be selected and loaded by the site (such as the Case View needing a case to first be selected via the Search page).
